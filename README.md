# playground

## Description
This repository includes my experimental software.
I often create new projects from scratch, possibly including finished and fully-functioning ones and works-in-progress that might want tweaking.

Additionally, this may include ideas for possible projects or proof-of-concepts.
List:

* StickInk - Customizable sticky notes
* Plannerism - Customizable planner based on the web, highlight increased range of colors to differentiate the day
* Bookie - Tentative scheduler applet based on the web
