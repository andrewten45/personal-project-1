# playground

## Description
This repository includes my experimental software.
I often create new projects from scratch, possibly including finished and fully-functioning ones and works-in-progress that might want tweaking.

Additionally, this may include ideas for possible projects or proof-of-concepts, located in the project_ideas.md file.
